## 🚕 Taxi Fare Prediction 📊
A machine learning project exploring linear regression to predict taxi fares based on various trip characteristics. This project is part of a Google ML Crash Course exercise.

## ✨ Features
* __Data Loading & Exploration:__ Load taxi trip data and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and key statistics. 📈
* __Feature Engineering:__ Selection of relevant features like TRIP_MILES, TRIP_SECONDS, FARE, COMPANY, PAYMENT_TYPE, and TIP_RATE. 🛠️

* __Correlation Analysis:__ Visualize feature correlations using a correlation matrix and pairplots. 🔗
* __Linear Regression Model:__ Implementation of a simple linear regression model using Keras/TensorFlow. 🤖
* __Model Training & Evaluation:__ Train the model with specified hyperparameters and evaluate its performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 📉
* __Interactive Visualizations:__ Plotting functions to visualize the loss curve and the model's fit to the data. 📊
